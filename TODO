write all in c++

Implement normal path finding for reward to reward for moving in direction for food even if tailiis on the way (go around)

can we write a mentor/trainer for model? Or it will be too hard?

If it sees Green, reward for moving to it and punish for other

Snake goes inside of +itself. Can we us A* parh finding to predict 5 moves ahead that some move is deadly and punish for moving there?

after training I need to detect tht model do not improve any more and run evaluation on it.

nimba?
