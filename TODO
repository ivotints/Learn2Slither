write all in c++

Implement normal path finding for reward to reward for moving in direction for food even if tailiis on the way (go around)

can we write a mentor/trainer for model? Or it will be too hard?

If it sees Green, reward for moving to it and punish for other

Snake goes inside of +itself. Can we us A* parh finding to predict 5 moves ahead that some move is deadly and punish for moving there?

after training I need to detect tht model do not improve any more and run evaluation on it.

after 50 epochs model is saved and has to be evaluated. It should be runned in the evaluation mode for 100 iterations to find averege length. Then results of the evaluation should be written to the model's folder in to the file 'evaluation.txt'.

Then averege of the model evaluation is saved in main. Training continues for next 50 iterations. Then evaluation cycle repeats. If new evaluation is better then previous, the best is rewriten. If new results are worser - we start count down. If next 10 models do not show any improvement in the averege snake's length - training stops.

Study overall should never stop - new snake with adjusted parameters should start. It will create file 'model_settings.txt' in model's folder and change them a bit from the original settings.txt in root folder

And do not change original settings.txt in root folder. every time when i start training it shoul load original settings and copy them to its folder, but when model stops because of no progress, it starts new process with flag, which tells him that he is a child and he need to load the settings from parent and adjust them. Then when this children stops, he create one more children which will compere the performance his parent and his grand parens ant take the best one's settings and adjust them and so on

i need the script which will scan in folder models/*/evaluation.txt for the  best result and return me a top of thenm with name of models
